# Preface

My dad once dropped some wisdom on me about leaving a legacy. He said there were three key things I should do:

1. Plant a seed and watch it grow into a beautiful tree.
2. Get creative and do something awesome, like writing a book (or anything else you’re passionate about).
3. Have some kiddos of your own.

When I was a wee little one, I planted a peach seed. Believe it or not, that peach tree is still standing strong in my parents’ backyard.

Oh, and guess what? I ended up having two amazing kids of my own!

And as for the book, this one ticks off that second point on my dad’s legacy list.

I use the following callouts for my notes:
